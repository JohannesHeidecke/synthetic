# synthetic

Synthetic is a set of tools to generate, analyze and perform evolutionary modeling of complex networks.

It currently aims to provide the following features:

    * Simple semantics to define network generators
    * Evolutionary search for network generative models
    * Eigenvector centrality based metrics
    * Measures of network similarity
    * Network morphogenesis simulation
